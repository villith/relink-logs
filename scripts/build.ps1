.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the GBFR Logs Tauri application end-to-end, including the prerequisite hook DLL.

.DESCRIPTION
    The release build (`npm run tauri build`) bundles `src-tauri/hook.dll` as a Tauri
    resource, but nothing in that command produces the DLL. If it's missing, the build
    fails in src-tauri/build.rs with:

        thread 'main' panicked at src-tauri\build.rs:15:14:
        Could not build Tauri app.: path matching hook.dll not found.

    This script performs the steps in the required order (matching .github/workflows/ci.yaml):
        1. npm install                              (unless -SkipInstall)
        2. cargo build --release --package hook     -> target/release/hook.dll
        3. copy hook.dll into src-tauri/            (where the release resource glob expects it)
        4. npm run tauri build                      (frontend build runs via beforeBuildCommand)

.PARAMETER SkipInstall
    Skip `npm install` (use when dependencies are already installed).

.PARAMETER Dev
    Run `npm run tauri dev` instead of a release build. In dev mode build.rs copies the
    hook DLL itself, so this script still builds the hook crate first for parity.
